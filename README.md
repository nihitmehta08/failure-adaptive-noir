Failure Adaptive Noir

A narrative behavioral medicine prototype.

Failure Adaptive Noir is a black and white interactive experience that operationalizes the 5A framework through a noir detective structure. Instead of rewarding perfection or streaks, the system reframes dietary missteps as investigable events.

Core principle:
Failure is data, not identity.

Concept

Each case follows a structured behavioral sequence:

Assess
Identify time, context, and barrier.

Advise
Provide concise, evidence aligned guidance.

Agree
Select one capacity matched micro commitment.

Assist
Add one structural or cognitive support tool.

Arrange
Define the next signal to monitor.

The player acts as both detective and subject. A lapse is not treated as a moral failure but as a case file requiring investigation and adaptive planning.

Design Principles

• Static and privacy preserving

Why This Exists

Most digital weight management tools reward streaks and punish lapses implicitly.

This prototype explores an alternative behavioral model where the core metric is recovery engagement, not perfection adherence.

The aim is to reduce shame, preserve self efficacy, and encourage structured return after deviation.
