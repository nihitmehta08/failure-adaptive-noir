Failure Adaptive Noir

A narrative behavioral intervention prototype.

Failure Adaptive Noir is a black-and-white interactive text experience that operationalizes the 5A framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) through a noir detective narrative.

Instead of rewarding perfection or streaks, the game reframes dietary missteps as investigable events. The player acts as both detective and subject, identifying contextual drivers of a behavior and selecting capacity-matched next steps.

Core principle:
Failure is data, not identity.

Concept

Each case follows a structured behavioral sequence:
	1.	Assess — Identify time, context, and barrier
	2.	Advise — Provide concise evidence-aligned guidance
	3.	Agree — Select one micro-commitment
	4.	Assist — Add one environmental or cognitive tool
	5.	Arrange — Define the next signal to monitor

The game is intentionally:
	•	Static (no backend)
	•	Privacy preserving (no user data stored)
	•	Minimalistic (text-based narrative)
	•	Designed as a proof-of-concept for failure-adaptive behavior change

Purpose

This prototype explores how structured behavioral medicine frameworks can be embedded in narrative environments to reduce shame and increase recovery engagement after lapses.
